## Origin

This is a personal project created by Danielle Lindblom as part of her portfolio.
The idea for this project came from a personal need - not being able to remember which restaurants were set up well and had been a good experience when utilizing her service dog.

Service Dogs Around Town has been built over 3 separate iterations with improvements to tech stack and user experience each time.

**Version 1**  
[Live Link](https://danielle254.github.io/ServiceDogsAroundTown_v1/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/Danielle254/ServiceDogsAroundTown_v1)

Built with React.js, JavaScript, Vanilla CSS, and utilizing Local Browser Storage, this was mainly a prototype and provided proof of concept.

## Setup - Run this project locally


## Future Enhancements

I have lots of ideas to make the user experience even better. I'd like to add the functionality where the list of places on the sidebar matches what is shown on the map and adjusts itself based on the map window changing, just like Google Maps does.  

Another big item on the To Do list is to allow multiple users to rate and review the same business location.
